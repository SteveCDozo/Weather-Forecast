# Weather-Forecast
Web Science Systems Development: Lab 2
Pulls weather data using OpenWeatherMap's API

I followed the w3schools tutorial and template available at http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp to learn how to retrieve the geolocation from the browser and display a map. I thought the map would be useful so the user could verify if the location determined by the coordinates is correct.

I used panels to display and group information that belonged to the same category.

When I made the call to the API, I used the units parameter to specify that I wanted the imperial units so I could get the temperature in farenheit.

I noticed that sometimes when I load the page, the console in the Chrome developer tools shows that an error occurs with the API call and the weather/forecast panels are left blank. I am not sure why this happens, but usually refreshing the page solves the problem.

Professor Plotka said I could take an extra day for this lab.
